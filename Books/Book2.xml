           <paragraph>NOW this is the next tale, and it tells how the Camel got his big hump.</paragraph>             
           <paragraph>In the beginning of years, when the world was so new and all, and the Animals were just beginning to work for Man, there was a Camel, and he lived in the middle of a Howling Desert because he did not want to work; and besides, he was a Howler himself. So he ate sticks and thorns and tamarisks and milkweed and prickles, most 'scruciating idle; and when anybody spoke to him he said 'Humph!' Just 'Humph!' and no more.</paragraph>    
           <paragraph>Presently the Horse came to him on Monday morning, with a saddle on his back and a bit in his mouth, and said, 'Camel, O Camel, come out and trot like the rest of us.'</paragraph>
           <paragraph>'Humph!' said the Camel; and the Horse went away and told the Man.</paragraph>
           <paragraph>Presently the Dog came to him, with a stick in his mouth, and said, 'Camel, O Camel, </paragraph>

        <content>
           <paragraph>come and fetch and carry like the rest of us.'</paragraph>
           <paragraph>'Humph!' said the Camel; and the Dog went away and told the Man.</paragraph>
           <paragraph>Presently the Ox came to him, with the yoke on his neck and said, 'Camel, O Camel, come and plough like the rest of us.'</paragraph>
           <paragraph>'Humph!' said the Camel; and the Ox went away and told the Man.</paragraph>
           <paragraph>At the end of the day the Man called the Horse and the Dog and the Ox together, and said, 'Three, O Three, I'm very sorry for you (with the world so new-and-all); but that Humph-thing in the Desert can't work, or he would have been here by now, so I am going to leave him alone, and you must work double-time to make up for it.'That made the Three very angry (with the world so new-and-all), and they held a palaver, and an indaba, and a punchayet, and a pow-wow on the edge of the Desert; and the Camel came chewing on milkweed most </paragraph>

           <paragraph>'scruciating idle, and laughed at them. Then he said 'Humph!' and went away again.</paragraph>
           <paragraph>Presently there came along the Djinn in charge of All Deserts, rolling in a cloud of dust (Djinns always travel that way because it is Magic), and he stopped to palaver and pow-pow with the Three.</paragraph>
           <paragraph>'Djinn of All Deserts,' said the Horse, 'is it right for any one to be idle, with the world so new-and-all?'</paragraph>
           <paragraph>'Certainly not,' said the Djinn.</paragraph>
           <paragraph>Well,' said the Horse, 'there's a thing in the middle of your Howling Desert (and he's a Howler himself) with a long neck and long legs, and he hasn't done a stroke of work since Monday morning. He won't trot.'</paragraph>
           <paragraph>'Whew!' said the Djinn, whistling, 'that's my Camel, for all the gold in Arabia! What does he say about it?'</paragraph>

           <paragraph>'He says "Humph!"' said the Dog;'and he won't fetch and carry.'</paragraph>
           <paragraph>'Does he say anything else?'</paragraph>
           <paragraph>'Only "Humph!"; and he won't plough,' said the Ox.</paragraph>
           <paragraph>'Very good,' said the Djinn. 'I'll humph him if you will kindly wait a minute.'</paragraph>
           <paragraph>The Djinn rolled himself up in his dust-cloak, and took a bearing across the desert, and found the Camel most 'scruciatingly idle, looking at his own reflection in a pool of water.</paragraph>
           <paragraph>'My long and bubbling friend,' said the Djinn, 'what's this I hear of your doing no work, with the world so new-and-all?'</paragraph>
           <paragraph>'Humph!' said the Camel.</paragraph>
           <paragraph>The Djinn sat down, with his chin in his hand, and began to think a Great Magic, </paragraph>

           <paragraph>while the Camel looked at his own reflection in the pool of water.</paragraph>
           <paragraph>'You've given the Three extra work ever since Monday morning, all on account of your 'scruciating idleness,' said the Djinn; and he went on thinking Magics, with his chin in his hand.</paragraph>
           <paragraph>'Humph!' said the Camel.</paragraph>
           <paragraph>'I shouldn't say that again if I were you,' said the Djinn; you might say it once too often. Bubbles, I want you to work.'</paragraph>
           <paragraph>And the Camel said 'Humph!' again; but no sooner had he said it than he saw his back, that he was so proud of, puffing up and puffing up into a great big lolloping humph.</paragraph>
           <paragraph>'Do you see that?' said the Djinn. 'That's your very own humph that you've brought upon your very own self by not working. To-day is Thursday, and you've done no work since </paragraph>

        <content>
            <paragraph>Monday, when the work began. Now you are going to work.'</paragraph>
            <paragraph>'How can I,' said the Camel, 'with this humph on my back?'</paragraph>
            <paragraph>'That's made a-purpose,' said the Djinn, 'all because you missed those three days. You will be able to work now for three days without eating, because you can live on your humph; and don't you ever say I never did anything for you. Come out of the Desert and go to the Three, and behave. Humph yourself!'</paragraph>
            <paragraph>And the Camel humphed himself, humph and all, and went away to join the Three. And from that day to this the Camel always wears a humph (we call it 'hump' now, not to hurt his feelings); but he has never yet caught up with the three days that he missed at the beginning of the world, and he has never yet learned how to behave.</paragraph>

           <paragraph>well you may see at the Zoo;But uglier yet is the hump we get From having too little to do.Kiddies and grown-ups too-oo-oo, If we haven't enough to do-oo-oo, We get the hump-- Cameelious hump-- The hump that is black and blue!</paragraph>
           <paragraph>We climb out of bed with a frouzly head And a snarly-yarly voice. We shiver and scowl and we grunt and we growl At our bath and our boots and our toys;</paragraph>
           <paragraph>And there ought to be a corner for me (And I know there is one for you) When we get the hump-- Cameelious hump-- The hump that is black and blue!</paragraph>
           <paragraph>The cure for this ill is not to sit still, Or frowst with a book by the fire; But to take a large hoe and a shovel also, And dig till you gently perspire;</paragraph>
           <paragraph>And then you will find that the sun and the wind.</paragraph>

           <paragraph> And the Djinn of the Garden too, Have lifted the hump-- The horrible hump-- The hump that is black and blue!</paragraph>
           <paragraph>I get it as well as you-oo-oo-- If I haven't enough to do-oo-oo-- We all get hump-- Cameelious hump-- Kiddies and grown-ups too!</paragraph>
